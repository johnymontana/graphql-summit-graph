What About the Database? How to Write Efficient Queries for GraphQL Resolvers,"When writing GraphQL servers, we often place a lot of emphasis on how to craft good resolvers. However, we don't often think about how to create good database queries to furnish the data for those resolvers. Let's look at how it's easy to fall into the trap of writing inefficient database queries and how we can use GraphQL itself to solve this problem.",Bayview,10/31/2019 11:30 AM,11:30 AM,Session (25 min),Deep dive (Server),Accepted,Y,,Intermediate,Ryan Chenkie,Elevate Digital Inc,"Owner, Developer",,https://drive.google.com/open?id=18mGXJ6ktUkWOVshtd9qhqitU4J-Nz3D5,https://twitter.com/ryanchenkie,https://github.com/chenkie,https://ryanchenkie.cm
